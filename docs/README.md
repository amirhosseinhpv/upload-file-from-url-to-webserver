**How to use?** Easily upload the `upload.php` file to your hosting area and enter its address, then
all you need is to paste URL you want to download and upload to your host, give it a name and hit UPLOAD. Easy as pie!

Hope you enjoy it, and BTW this tool is for personal use, so don’t get too serious about security bugs and stuff. ;D
