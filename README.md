**How to use?** Easily upload the `upload.php` file to your hosting area and
open it in new tab, then all you need is to paste the URL you want to download
and upload to your host, give it a name and hit UPLOAD. Easy as pie!

Hope you enjoy it, and BTW this tool is for personal use, so donâ€™t get too
serious about security bugs and stuff ;)
