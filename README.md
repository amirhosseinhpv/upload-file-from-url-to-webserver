#### How to use?

Upload the `upload.php` file to your hosting area and open it in
new tab, then paste the URL you want to download and upload to your server, give
it a name and hit UPLOAD. Easy as pie!

Hope you enjoy it, and BTW this tool is for personal use, so donâ€™t get too
serious about security bugs and stuff ;)
